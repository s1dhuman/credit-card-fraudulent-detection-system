# Credit Card Fraudulent Detection System

Credit card fraud poses a significant threat to financial institutions and cardholders, leading to substantial financial losses and potential harm to individuals. 
In order to mitigate the risks associated with fraudulent transactions, there is a critical need for an advanced Credit Card Fraud Detection System. 
This system should leverage data mining techniques and ML algorithms to analyze a comprehensive set of transaction features and patterns, enabling the early detection and prevention of unauthorized or fraudulent activities. 
The objective is to develop a robust and efficient system that can accurately identify potential fraud in real-time, thereby safeguarding the financial interests and security of both financial institutions and credit card users.

The purpose of this project is to detect the fraudulent transactions made by credit cards by the use of machine learning techniques, to stop fraudsters from the unauthorized usage of customersâ€™ 
accounts.
